        <h2>Hypoallergenic dog breeds</h2>
        Hypoallergenic dog breeds are specially bred to minimize allergic reactions in people sensitive to pet dander.
        These breeds have hair instead of fur, reducing shedding and dander. Popular hypoallergenic breeds include
        Poodles, Bichon Frises, Maltese, and Yorkshire Terriers. While no breed is completely hypoallergenic, these dogs
        are often more suitable for individuals with allergies or asthma.
