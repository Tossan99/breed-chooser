- It's dimensions and design is also consistent with some of the other pages to make navigating the different pages smoother.

- __Breeds Section__

- The breed section immediately catches the user's attention with a few cute dog images and the interactive mouse hoovering
- This section is the hearth of the website and is used to navigate the information provided.

- __Footer__

- The footer section provides the user with social media links to futher interact with us through other mediums.
- When hoovering over the social media icons they light up with their original logo color and grow in size.
- This design makes the footer both very satisfying to interact with and helps the user recognise the company logo.

### Features Left to Implement

- I would love to figure out a way for the user to navigate between the breed categories without having to go back to the home page.
