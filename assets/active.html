        <h2>Active dog breeds</h2>
        Active dog breeds are known for their high energy levels, athleticism, and enthusiasm for physical activities.
        They excel in activities such as running, hiking, agility, and various dog sports. These breeds require regular
        exercise, mental stimulation, and training to thrive, making them ideal companions for individuals or families
        with active lifestyles. However, they may not be suitable for those unable to meet their exercise needs and
        provide the necessary outlets for their energy.

                <p>Border Collies are extremely intelligent and excel at various dog sports and activities. If you're an
                    active person who enjoys spending time outdoors and participating in activities like agility,
                    obedience trials, or herding, a Border Collie could be a great companion. They thrive when given
                    mental stimulation and plenty of exercise, making them a good choice for individuals or families who
                    can provide them with an active and engaging lifestyle.
